<!-- Hidden remark from a contributor: It is not 💩! -->

NeoVim plugin with which you can track your usage.
The examples speak for themselves.
Logs are stored locally, so no sensitive data leaves your machine.

# Setup

Use your favourite package manager, parameters are optional. 

- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
```lua
Plug 'gaborvecsei/usage-tracker.nvim'
```

- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{
  "gaborvecsei/usage-tracker.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("usage-tracker").setup({})
  end,
}
```

# Configuration

The setup takes these default parameters

```lua
require('usage-tracker').setup({
    keep_eventlog_days = 14,
    cleanup_freq_days = 7,
    event_wait_period_in_sec = 5,
    inactivity_threshold_in_min = 5,
    inactivity_check_freq_in_sec = 5,
    verbose = 0,
    telemetry_endpoint = "" -- you'll need to start the restapi for this feature
})
```

| `verbose`                      | Debug messages are printed if it's `>0`                                           | int  | 1       |
| `telemetry_endpoint`           | If defined data will be stored in a sqlite db via the restapi                     | str  | ''      |


# Usage

A timer starts when you enter a buffer and stops when you leave the buffer (or quit nvim).
Both normal and insert mode is counted.

There is inactivity detection, which means that if you don't have any keys pressed down (normal, insert mode) then
the timer is stopped automatically. Please see the configuration to set your personal preference.

## Commands

- `UsageTrackerShowAgg <aggregation_type> [start_date] [end_date]`
  - `aggregation_type` can be `filepath`, `project`, `filetype`
  - `start_date` and `end_date` is in format `YYYY-MM-DD`, range for the aggregation
- `UsageTrackerShowFilesLifetime`
- `UsageTrackerShowVisitLog [filepath]`
  - If no `filepath` is defined then all the logs are visible
- `UsageTrackerShowDailyAggregation`
- `UsageTrackerShowDailyAggregationByFiletypes [filetypes]`
  - E.g.: `:UsageTrackerShowDailyAggregationByFiletypes lua markdown jsx`
- `UsageTrackerShowDailyAggregationByProject [project_name]`
- `:UsageTrackerRemoveEntry <filepath> <entry timestamp> <exit timestamp>`
  - This is a utility function with which you can remove a wrongly logged item from the json
- `:UsageTrackerCleanup <threshold_in_min>`
 
## Telemetry (separately storing data in a DB)

Usage data saved locally (in the json file) is cleaned up after the set days,
but if you'd like to keep it longer in a separate SqliteDB, then this is why this feature exists.

You can use it for custom analysis, just make sure the endpoint is live.

### How to enable it

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/gaborvecsei/usage-tracker.nvim.git
$ cd usage-tracker.nvim/telemetry_api
$ docker-compose up -d
```

If you'd like to use a different volume mount then change it in the `docker-compose.yml` file

Then you should define the `telemetry_endpoint="http://<HOST>:<PORT>"` (if you did not changed a thing the endpoint is `http://localhost:8000`)
parameter in the `setup({..., telemetry_endpoint="http://<HOST>:<PORT>"})`.

## Examples

Use **`:UsageTrackerShowAgg filetype 2023-07-07 2023-07-08`**

```
Total usage in minutes from 2023-07-07 00:00 to 2023-07-08 00:00

```

You can view the file-specific stats with **`:UsageTrackerShowFilesLifetime`**.

```

/.config/nvim/init.vim                               200         1.56
```

You can view the file-specific event (entry, exit) with **`:UsageTrackerShowVisitLog [filepath]`**.
Call the function when you are at the file you are interested in without any arguments or you can provide the filename as an argument.
An event pair is only saved when more time elapsed than `event_wait_period_in_sec` seconds between the entry and the exit.
Here is an example output:

```
Enter                Exit                 Time (min)
-------------------  -------------------  ----------

2023-06-27 13:44:48  2023-06-27 13:47:05  2.28
```

Use **:UsageTrackerShowDailyAggregationByFiletypes lua python markdown** to get daily usage stats

```

The data is stored in a json file called `usage_data.json` in the neovim data cache folder (`vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/usage_data.json"`)

# Troubleshooting

## Know issues

These are some of the issues I found when using the plugin. Bughunters are always welcome to check on these. 🤗

- Local data does not match up with the telemetry DB 100%
- Some items in the visit logs are not "closed" - there is no exit time
- For some visit logs the elapsed time is just too big (you can't code 25 hours in a day)

## Issues & Solutions

### Wrongly logged visit entry

If you find a wrongly logged entry then you'll need to remove it from the json file and from the sqlite db
(if you've enabled telemetry)

- Use the `UsageTrackerRemoveEntry <filepath> <entry> <exit>` utility command to remove the item form the json file
- As a 2nd step remove it from the sqlite DB with
  `DELETE FROM visits WHERE filepath = 'your_file_path' AND entry = your_entry_time AND exit = your_exit_time;`
